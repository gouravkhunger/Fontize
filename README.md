Fontize is an Android library, written in kotlin, that enables your android app have multiple fonts for your `TextView`s
and switch  between them in a jiffy!

A quick demo:

</div>

## Adding Fontize to your project

Include jitpack in your root `build.gradle` file.

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

And add it's dependency to your app level `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.gouravkhunger:Fontize:1.0.1"
}
```

Sync the project and you'll have imported Fontize successfully.

## Start using Fontize

Make sure you have all your fonts in the `res/font/` directory. Support for font files in the `assets` folder will ship soon!

Rename all the `TextView`s or `AppCompatTextView`s in your project to `com.github.gouravkhunger.fontize.FontizeTextView` - You don't have to change anything else, and the view would still perform the same :)

Before:

```xml
<TextView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="@string/switch_font_to"
    android:layout_marginTop="150dp"
    android:textSize="18sp"/>
```

After:

```xml
<com.github.gouravkhunger.fontize.FontizeTextView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="@string/switch_font_to"
    android:layout_marginTop="150dp"
    android:textSize="18sp"/>
```

To set up a default font for the `TextView`s that should load at the startup, add this line to the beginning of your launcher activity:

```kotlin
Fontize(this).setDefaultFont(R.font.exo_2) // replace with the font you desire
```

To update the font for all of your app, simple call this line from anywhere inside the app:

```kotlin
Fontize(this).updateFont(R.font.zen_old_mincho) // updates fontFamily of all the TextViews throughout app
```

**Note**:

- `this` must be an Acitvity or Application context.
- This requires recreation of the activity, which can be done by `recreate()`, or prompt the user to relaunch the app to make the changes take effect.

## How does it work?

Fontize saves the resource ID of the font you provide to `SharedPreferences`. It extends `AppCompatTextView` class to inherit all the properties of a `TextView`, but overrides the default inflating behaviour. It applies the typography when the view is inflated.

### Only `TextViews`?
I'll try to add support for other views in the future. Contributions are always welcome.
